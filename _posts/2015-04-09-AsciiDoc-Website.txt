= Local AsciiDoc Website

In my link:http://tedbergeron.github.io/2015/03/29/Atom-Editor-AsciiDoc.html[last post] I briefly mentioned how you could make a local website out of your docs using only

* A text editor, like Notepad
* A browser extension in Chrome link:https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/asciidoctorjs-live-previe/iaalpfgpbocpdfblpnhhgllgbdbchmia?hl=en-US[Asciidoctor.js Live Preview]
* A little bit of AsciiDoc formatting

I have a lot of documentation that I update and refer to everyday. It is marked up with AsciiDoc. I find the best way to work with it is to organize all my docs and link them together into a mini-website on my laptop.

== Templates to get you started
To get you started, I've created a few docs and linked them together so you can quickly see how this works.

Start by cloning this repo  link:https://github.com/tedbergeron/Asciidoctor-LivePreview-Website[Asciidoctor-LivePreview-Website]

You can just download the .ZIP and place the files together in a directory.

== Asciidoctor.js Live Preview

Install the Asciidoctor.js Live Preview in your browser if you don't already have it

* Chrome: link:https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/asciidoctorjs-live-previe/iaalpfgpbocpdfblpnhhgllgbdbchmia?hl=en-US[Asciidoctor.js Live Preview]
* Firefox: link:https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/asciidoctorjs-live-preview/?src=search[Asciidoctor.js Live Preview] (not as full-featured as Chrome one yet)

Set the options for it

* Safe mode: _unsafe_
* Preview .txt files: icon:check[role=black] _(so you can use these .txt files in addition to .adoc files)_
* Click save.


== Open the index.txt in your browser

Find the directory where you copied the text files from the link:https://github.com/tedbergeron/Asciidoctor-LivePreview-Website[Asciidoctor-LivePreview-Website] repo.

Right-click on index.txt and open with Chrome.

You should see it open and render like a mini-website. Click around and test it out.

== Start Editing it.

When you look at the text files you'll notice that the index.txt file has

[source, AsciiDoc]
----
include::header.txt[]

include::footer.txt[]
----

You can use those on all your docs to create a navigation menu at the top and a mini-sitemap at the bottom.

== Linking your docs together

The main AsciiDoc code you'll need to hook your docs together is link. It's pretty straight forward to use

[source, AsciiDoc]
----
link:AnotherDocument.txt[Another Document]
----

== Bookmark your index.txt file

Bookmark your main doc. You might want to name it README.txt. Then write links to all your other docs creating a simple website.

== Not quite a wiki

It is not the same as a wiki but it is so simple to edit. I usually edit in one window on the left and preview the changes in Chrome on the right.

You could build an intranet site on your network using this concept.

And if you are looking for something better than Notepad to write your docs, try the link:http://tedbergeron.github.io/2015/03/29/Atom-Editor-AsciiDoc.html[Atom Editor for AsciiDoc]
